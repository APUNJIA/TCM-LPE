If we do a sudo -l, it shows us what all commands you can run as root without a password.

Then you can go to GTFOBins and search for the application listed in the result of the previous command and look what you can do to escalate if you have sudo privileges.

A great resource for shell escaping is GTFOBins: [https://gtfobins.github.io/](https://gtfobins.github.io/)

NOTE: If you wanna escape VIM: :q!
