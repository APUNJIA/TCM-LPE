Basically, when you run sudo -l, and you see a message that says:

"(ALL, !root) /bin/bash"

Which basically means that you cannot run /bin/bash as root.

But, guess what... you can run /bin/bash as root. How? Here's how:

```
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
```

Basically it will subtract 1 from the userID making it 0, which is root. 

Description: Sudo does not check for the existence of the specified userID and executes the command with arbitrary userID with the sudo privileges

-u#-1 returns as 0 which is root.
