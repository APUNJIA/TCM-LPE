Well... the exploit basically depends on the fact that one of the environment variables has a variable called pw_feedback.

Basically, when you're typing out a password in a linux shell, it does not show anything. But, there are some cases where it shows an asterisk(\*) when a password is being typed out. That is the pw_feedback thing in action. 

Before you run the exploit, run this command to see if you can run this exploit:

```shell
sudo -V
```

Then if everything checks out, just run the exploit and you will get root.
